# A-frame Pathfinding & Movement Restriction
<p>Includes the Blender file used to create the mesh and nav-mesh.</p>
<p>The file demonstrates to aspects of the pathfinder component: The ability to have a bot navigate a path around an environement and to restrict the player's movement to avoid collisions with the environment. For the latter this negates the need to use collision detection which can be computationally expensive therefore reserving it for only necessary aspects of the experience.</p>
<p>This file uses an earlier version of A-frame but is expected to be update shortly to include the latest. The issue is that the bot pathfinding does not work as expected in A-frame Ver 1.0.3. However, the player path restriction does still work.</p>
<p>If you see an better way of implementing this I would love to hear from you :) </p>
<p>Thank you and good luck!</p>
